# BLE_provisioning
BLE provisioning of esp32 using BLE application

This code is for BLE Provisioning of esp32.
We can connect our esp to any near-by WIFI with the right password and SSID using Bluetooth provision application.

You can directly copy this code onto the Arduino IDE and it will print a QR code in the Serial Monitor. 
If the QR code isnt being scanned from the Serial Monitor paste the link provided below directly on the browser search tab and a more clear QR code will be shown.

If there is an error while upload regarding package size being to big go in the Tools -> Partition Scheme ->Huge App(3MB no OTA/ 1MB SPIFFS)


You can also scan without the QR code which can be easily accessed from the Application.
